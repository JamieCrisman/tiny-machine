# Tiny Machine

A VM inspired things like the original gameboy, [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html), [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), and [crafting interpreters](craftinginterpreters.com/).

Currently, figuring out the byte code stuff. Will be moving towards adding a bad programming language on top of this because that sounds fun.
